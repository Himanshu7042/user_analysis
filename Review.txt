Based on the weekly user growth accounting data, the company is showing steady performance with an average quick ratio of 1.06. This indicates that for every user lost to churn, the company is gaining just over one new or resurrected user. While this suggests a more balanced user growth trajectory, there is still room for improvement in user acquisition and resurrection to further offset churn. The average retention rate of 72% remains strong, highlighting that a significant portion of users are continuing to engage with the platform.
